## Have a low dopamine morning
- People with ADHD are ‚Äòdopamine deficient‚Äô
- Dopamine is our natural motivator ‚Üí our drive to act and pursue rewards
- If you‚Äôre like me, mornings will often look like this:
	- Wake up
	- Check phone (dopamine üìà)
	- Big breakfast (dopamine üìà)
	- Drink coffee (dopamine üìà)
	- Rush to get out the door (dopamine üìà)
	- Listen to music (dopamine üìà)
- By now, our brains are overloaded with dope and like any addiction, on the prowl for more. This means performing routine tasks for our jobs/lives will feel nearly impossible because they do not satisfy our craving for more. (Focus üìâ)
- Here are some simple tips on how to have a low-dopamine morning:
	- Avoid checking your phone as long as possible (keep it in another room)
	- Drink a full glass of water
	- Avoid caffeine
	- Avoid a highly caloric breakfast
	- Read a chapter of a book (slow, engaged, accomplishment)
## Meditate
- Meditation involves focusing the mind and becoming more aware of the present moment. Regular practice helps strengthen your brain‚Äôs prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus (linked to focus).
- **There is no such thing as a bad meditation session.**
	- It can last 5 to 10 minutes
	- You can close your eyes, or focus on a particular object
	- You can sit in silence, or repeat an anchoring word throughout your practice
- Apps [Oak ‚Äî Meditation & Breathin](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oak-meditation-breathing/id1210209691)g

## Write things down
- I called my Dad (who also struggles with ADHD) and asked if he had any tips and I‚Äôll never forget his advice: ‚ÄúYou need to write things down.‚Äù
- ![|400](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*l9f8bFz-qov4KG1QF9mSVw.jpeg)
	- Objectives from the 1st page of my Black n‚Äô Red Notebook
- Writing helps in so many ways. It‚Ä¶
	- Enhances clarity by slowing down the endless stream of thoughts
	- Boosts concentration by focusing on our processes and tasks at hand
	- Improves our memory and information retention

## Exercise
- As my friend Fletch Barnes wisely said, ‚ÄúWe move our bodies to slow down our minds.‚Äù
- Exercise improves circulation, increasing the flow of blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the brain. The impact is overall improved brain health ‚Äî including memory, problem-solving, and attention.
- Physical activity helps us regulate our dopamine levels, which improves focus and attention, providing a natural remedy for ADHD symptoms.

## Reduce Apps / Social Media
- Many apps and social media are designed to give you quick dopamine hits so you crave checking them throughout the day.
- Something I learned recently is how Twitter (now X) measures its ‚Äúkey performance‚Äù (also known as KPIs)‚Ä¶
- ![|400](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:604/1*lqDzx-HAtHx2DWJUIEVqfg.png)
	- An illustrative tweet by Elon Musk highlights users' time spent on X
	- This graph represents the ‚Äútotal seconds‚Äù users spent on X and the positive correlation that figure has with X's success.

## Berocca ([link to Amazon](https://a.co/d/jbOT9kZ))
- Berocca is the first clean, tasty, non-overwhelming supplement that improves my focus for about 1‚Äì2 hours.
- It contains high levels of B and C vitamins.
- B vitamins help maintain proper nerve function and are involved in neurotransmitters that regulate mood and brain function. For example, vitamin B6 is important to your brain's serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels, which are crucial for focus.
- Vitamin C also helps improve mood, directly impacting your focus and productivity.

## Stay Away From Substances
- substances like sugar, alcohol, and caffeine
- People with ADHD are particularly susceptible to a habitual relationship with substances thanks to their ability to spike dopamine levels.
- Many substances disrupt the natural balance of neurotransmitters in the brain. Avoiding them will help you maintain a natural balance, which supports sustained focus and alertness.
